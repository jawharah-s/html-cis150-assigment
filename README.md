# Tri & Succeed Sports – Coaches Page

Small HTML/CSS assignment from my CIS 150 class.

I was given the text, images, and a basic layout file, and I had to build the
“Meet our Coaches” page and finish the styling.

What I did here:
- Wrote the `tss_coach.html` page with semantic HTML (header, nav, section, article, footer).
- Linked two style sheets: one for layout and one for my color/typography styles.
- Built `coach_styles.css` to handle fonts, colors, navigation hover effects, and blockquote styling.
- Used a custom web font (`Nobile`) and pseudo-elements to add opening/closing quotes around the testimonial.
- Added custom bullet icons for the coaches’ credentials using `check.png`.

Open `tss_coach.html` in a browser to see the page.
