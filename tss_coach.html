      <h1>Meet our Coaches</h1>

      <aside>
         <blockquote>
            I have been given great feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches.
            This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling class and it made a 
            huge difference to my spring rides. The coaches are 
            caring professionals and they know their business.
         </blockquote>
      </aside>

      <p>
         Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through
         motivation, support, and education. We have years of experience with 
         athletes of all ages and abilities and we're happy to assist any athlete 
         committed to pursuing his or her dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
         We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also offer
         small group practices. Our classes are never large in number. We believe that
         a low coach-to-athlete ratio provides the best results in the shortest time.
      </p>

      <p>
         Come in and introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.
      </p>
